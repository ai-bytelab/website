Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) is a technology that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate the processing of documents. This can include extracting data from documents, classifying documents, and routing documents to the appropriate people or departments.

IDP has many advantages over traditional manual document processing. It automatically reads and analyzes documents, converting them into structured and easily searchable data. This means employees don't have to spend hours doing this tedious task manually, freeing them up to focus on more important work.

It can be faster, more accurate, and more efficient. It can also help to reduce errors and improve compliance.

### Why do we need IDP?

In today's world, businesses generate a lot of documents. These documents can include invoices, contracts, customer records, etc. Manually processing these documents can be time-consuming and error-prone.

IDP can automate this process, freeing up employees to focus on other tasks and improving the accuracy of document processing.

### How is IDP used in different industries?
IDP has various applications across different industries. Here are some common examples:

- **Invoice Processing:** IDP can automatically extract important data from invoices, like invoice number, date, amount, and vendor details. This helps with tasks such as accounts payable and sending invoices to customers.

- **Contract Management:** IDP can extract key information from contracts, including terms, conditions, and deadlines. This enables better contract tracking, ensuring compliance, and managing contracts effectively.
- **Compliance:** IDP automates data extraction from compliance-related documents, such as customer records or financial reports. This ensures adherence to regulations and helps maintain compliance standards.

- **Fraud Detection:** IDP plays a role in detecting fraudulent documents by identifying inconsistencies or missing information, such as fraudulent invoices. This helps businesses protect themselves from financial losses.

- **Customer Service:** IDP enhances customer service by providing faster and more accurate information. For instance, it can automatically extract customer contact details from documents, enabling prompt communication with customers.

These are just a few examples of how IDP is utilized across industries. Its ability to automate document processing and extract relevant data makes it a valuable tool for improving efficiency, reducing errors, and enhancing customer experiences.

### What are the benefits of IDP?
There are many benefits to using IDP, including:

- **Speed:** IDP can automate the processing of documents, which can save time and improve efficiency.

- **Accuracy:** IDP can be more accurate than manual document processing, which can help to reduce errors and improve compliance.

- **Cost savings:** IDP can help to reduce the costs associated with document processing, such as the costs of manual data entry and the costs of storage and retrieval.

- **Improved customer service:** IDP can help to improve customer service by reducing the time it takes to process documents and by providing customers with more accurate information.
Increased compliance: IDP can help organizations to meet regulatory requirements by ensuring that documents are processed correctly and that data is accurate.

- **Improved decision-making:** IDP can help organizations to make better decisions by providing them with insights into their data.

- **Free up human resources:** IDP can free up human resources to focus on more strategic tasks, such as developing new products or services.
